How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  I can ensure that my code/program is functional and secure by taking a handful of steps/precautions. First, alwyas validate input and carefully examine compiler errors. Try keeping the code simple and direct with your exact objectives. Test your code often and in all of the different stages of the development lifecycle.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  This is done at the beginning of development. This is your best opportunity to ask specific questions to your client and lay out exactly what it is they need. After doing this, you can present ideas on how to make it happen with your development team. This will allow the team to find the best possible solution for the project and the best way to execute it.
  
How do I approach designing software?

  Always have the end user in mind when designing software. If you can make sure they are safe and engaged in your application, you will be successful. This is why I believe UI design to be so important. Even if your system is great, if it is unappealing or hard to use, it will drive users away. Security and ease of use/nice UI are the most important factors when approaching a software project.
